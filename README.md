# mazesolving
A MATLAB script used to direct a car through a maze. For FSE100.
kbcontrol.m was used to manually drive the car for testing purposes, but is unnecessary when using the fully self-driving script.
For those unfamiliar with the project, the idea was to create a LEGO Mindstorm car that was able to navigate a maze with a distance tracker, color sensor, a motor, and various other Mindstorm tools.
Various tweaks were made to optimize for the specific maze we were using, and may need to be adjusted to work more effectively.
